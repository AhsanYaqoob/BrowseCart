# Prodify

Prodify is a product catalog and browsing application built with React. It allows users to browse products by categories, view detailed product information, and experience an intuitive UI. The app fetches product data from an external API, making it easy to extend and integrate with any backend.

## Features

- **Dynamic Product Display**: Products are displayed dynamically with a click-to-view details functionality.
- **Highlight Selected Category**: The currently selected category is highlighted in the category panel.
- **Responsive Grid**: The products are displayed in a responsive grid that adjusts to screen size.
- **Loading Indicators**: Shows loading states while fetching categories and products.
- **Scrollable Product List**: Product grid scrolls independently while the category panel remains fixed.
- **Compact Product View on Selection**: Once a product is selected, the layout changes to highlight the product details.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to fetch product and category data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components in a responsive and clean manner.
